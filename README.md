# iClass Technical Test

Welcome to this deeply insane technical test. You are suggested to open this with VSCode. Use of other editors like IDEA is also allowed but not supported. We try to resemble the workflow that you should be following if you work here.

## Technologies invloved (will be added in future)
- Docker/Docker Compose
- Linux/Linux scripting
- Raw HTML/JS/CSS
- Raw PHP
- MySQL
- Laravel

Each of the subdirectory in this folder is a suite of challenges for the specific technologies. You are not required to complete all of them, we just want to know how much do you know. However, given that our deployment use Docker, Docker knowledge is mandatory to solve these challenges.

## Prequsites
You absolutely need `docker` and `docker-compose` to run anything here. This is mandatory. Your backend challenges and some frontend challenges is evaluated by running `docker-compose up -d` in this directory. For local development, you should be able to install the required dependencies if your know the correesponding technologies. 

## How to sumbit
Please fork this repo, switch it into private repo, work on it, and then add `ayhoihang`, `iclassadmin` and `ken@itwakes.me` into collabrators. Please send an email to us or contact us otherwise after you made us collabrators.
